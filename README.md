# Move-files
This is a bash script tool I created to make moving files around my server easier.
Path structions can be complex, and having to remember them is a pain.
With this script I simply enter the script name along with the file or folder I want to move, it presents me with the selections and I simply enter the corresponding number.  The file/folder will then be moved to the appropriate location.
